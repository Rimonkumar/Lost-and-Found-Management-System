📦 Lost and Found Management System

This repository contains the document-based software engineering project titled Lost and Found Management System.
developed as part of the **Software Engineering** course at American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB).

 📘 Project Overview

The **Lost and Found Management System** is a proposed web-based platform that streamlines the process of reporting, tracking, 
and recovering lost items in large public or organizational spaces such as schools, transit hubs, and offices. It automates
the matching of lost and found objects using intelligent algorithms and offers a user-friendly interface for reporting and searching.



 🎯 Objectives

- Digitalize the lost & found process
- Improve item recovery rate
- Reduce manual errors and administrative workload
- Ensure secure, centralized data storage and access

 📄 This is a Document-Based Project

This project emphasizes documentation and planning rather than implementation. It includes:

- ✅ Project Description, Problem Statement & Proposed Solution
- ✅ Selection & Justification of Process Model (Scrum)
- ✅ Use Case & Sequence Diagrams
- ✅ Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
- ✅ Gantt Chart (Project Timeline)
- ✅ Risk Management Plan
- ✅ Test Case (Example Profile Update Test)
- ✅ Individual Contribution & Project Roles

> 🛠️ Through this documentation, we explored how to **plan, structure, and manage a software project** step-by-step, following real-world software engineering methodologies.





 📌 Key Learning Outcomes

- How to select and justify a **software development process model** (Scrum)
- How to **structure a project** using WBS and Gantt charts
- Basics of **risk analysis**, **project planning**, and **testing**
- Importance of **stakeholder involvement**, feedback loops, and iterative planning

---

📢 This project serves as a complete example of planning and managing a software engineering project from concept to testing — through documentation only.
